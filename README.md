# AspireRunner

A standalone runner for the .NET [Aspire Dashboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/dashboard/standalone) which can be used to display OpenTelemetry
data (traces, metrics, and logs) from any application.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the runner requires both the .NET 8 SDK and the [aspire workload](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/setup-tooling?tabs=dotnet-cli%2Cunix) to
> be installed.
>
>
> Eventually (wip), it'll be able to automatically fetch and install the dashboard and therefore would only require the .NET runtime.
