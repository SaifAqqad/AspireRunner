# AspireRunner

A standalone runner for the .NET [Aspire Dashboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/dashboard/standalone) which can display OpenTelemetry data (traces,
metrics, and logs) from any application.

The runner can be used as a [dotnet tool](./src/AspireRunner.Tool/README.md) or as part of an [ASP.NET Core application](./src/AspireRunner.AspNetCore/README.md), it will automatically download the dashboard if it's not installed, and will run and manage the dashboard process.

> [!NOTE]
> The runner will prioritize using the dashboard bundled with the [Aspire workload](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/setup-tooling?tabs=windows&pivots=visual-studio), if it's installed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While the runner itself targets .NET 6 (and later), the dashboard requires the .NET 8/9 runtime to run.
>
> Meaning that the runner can be used as part of a .NET 6 application, but you'll still need the .NET 8/9 runtime to run the dashboard.
